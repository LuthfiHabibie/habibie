00:01:19.758 --> 00:01:21.461
My hands, your hands

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.625
Tied up like two ships

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:25.859
Drifting, weightless

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.805
Waves try to break it

00:01:28.094 --> 00:01:30.547
I'd do anything to save it

00:01:32.172 --> 00:01:34.656
Why is it so hard to save it?

00:01:36.422 --> 00:01:38.289
My heart, your heart

00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:40.406
Sit tight like bookends

00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:42.477
Pages between us

00:01:42.688 --> 00:01:44.656
Written with no end

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.453
So many words we're not saying

00:01:48.938 --> 00:01:51.039
Don't wanna wait 'til it's gone

00:01:51.836 --> 00:01:53.836
You make me strong

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.187
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"

00:02:00.922 --> 00:02:05.008
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:08.414
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

00:02:08.516 --> 00:02:11.883
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong


00:02:12.203 --> 00:02:14.570
That you make me strong?

00:02:17.914 --> 00:02:19.984
Think of how much

00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:22.148
Love that's been wasted

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:24.281
People always

00:02:24.313 --> 00:02:26.484
Trying to escape it

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:29.367
Move on to stop their heart breaking

00:02:30.438 --> 00:02:32.781
But there's nothing I'm running from

00:02:33.563 --> 00:02:35.750
You make me strong

00:02:36.296 --> 00:02:39.251
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"

00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:44.309
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

00:02:44.957 --> 00:02:47.507
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:51.515
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?

00:02:52.795 --> 00:02:59.915
So, baby, hold on to my heart, oh

00:03:01.412 --> 00:03:06.137
Need you to keep me from falling apart

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.475
I'll always hold on

00:03:13.442 --> 00:03:15.667
'Cause you make me strong

00:03:16.493 --> 00:03:19.008
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"

00:03:20.385 --> 00:03:23.825
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

00:03:24.535 --> 00:03:27.835
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

00:03:28.112 --> 00:03:31.532
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?

00:03:32.703 --> 00:03:35.923
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"

00:03:36.904 --> 00:03:40.589
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:44.322
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.845
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?

00:03:48.367 --> 00:03:49.682
That you make me...

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:52.643
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:57.501
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:01.153
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker

00:04:01.485 --> 00:04:04.785
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong

00:04:05.323 --> 00:04:07.323
That you make me strong?
